It is very easy to create a new object.

But, unfortunately, an empty object is often useless

The hard part will be in the object itself.

At least, this sample code gives you the impression that
making a game object is easy.

So let's enjoy this moment of simplicity

```javascript
import { GameObject } from "rpgbaker";

export default class MyNewObject extends GameObject {}
```
